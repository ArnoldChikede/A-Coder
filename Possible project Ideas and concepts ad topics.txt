Project Scope 

Use an ESP 32 for cloud based services and remote controlling  
	The ESP32 will be used to leverage its wifi and bte capabilities to use Amazon web services

	Python will be need for subscribing and punlishing topics to the the cloud using the BOTO3 SDK for this (so some python projects need to be done a bit to come to pace)

	Possibility of connecting ESP32 with SRM32 through simple serial connection and use the High performance capabilities of STM32(This is in a case of not being able to use ESP32  single chip or two of them
	at once.....if time and skills allow , would like to use STM32-----ESP32 connection.

	IF all works out, we can make a custom board combining the STM32 AND ESP32 on one board together with certain actuators, which will gather information from the surroundings for proper control  


Now, what we need to do is look for a cool PROJECT that is practical
