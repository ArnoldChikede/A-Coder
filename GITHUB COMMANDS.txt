cd ~/Documents = instead of writing the full path you can start at here..short forh= home directory then we go to documents

git pull = is more like updating the local repository that you already have when ypu make changes say in the remote repo

git status = tells me things that i have changed in the local directory that i have committed or pushed yet when  i change them in the locak directory 


git add <file name>  = this tells git what kind of files do you want to add to que up for the sending process coz you can have sometimes say 3 files and you want to commit them differently...so simply means you que and commit only the things that you want to send at a specific moment 

git add .    = this however stages everything 


git commit -m "Example message"   = this includes are commit message for what you did and takes a snapshot of whats happening 


git push  = finally we push the changes to the remote repo
